That word strikes so much fear in my heart. I am so afraid of being obsolete. I am so afraid of forgetting how to learn. I am so afraid my brain is inelastic. I am so afraid of being static.

I have always been good with technology and the go to person when anything needed to be set up like the first family computer in the kitchen (remember the fear parents had of chat rooms?), getting that MySpace profile perfect with my basic HTML tags, or setting up a MailChimp email sequence.

Yes, I can do those things, but there are 8 year olds who have been raised with an iPad attached to their crib who might be able to do it better. Technology is so native to them. I'm scared of what they can do that I can't. I don't want to be left behind. 

But, being raised without a device in hand is also an advantage. I remember a time without an app to reach anyone at any time, solving math problems on paper and showing my work, and the freedom of logging on and logging off whenever I wanted (or when my parents said my 30 minutes of computer time was up).

Coding is a way to creatively solve problems. It's a new way to learn. It's a way for me to push myself, to get frustrated, to have moments I want to throw my MacBook but won't because waiting at the Apple store is more frustrating. 

Learing to code is a way for me to conquer my fears of becoming obsolete.
